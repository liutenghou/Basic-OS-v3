tests are commented out in user.c under: testdoc.txt tests

• 1. Test showing prioritization of signals 
signals are prioritized by their order in the signaltable within the pcb

• 2. syssighandler() test case

• 3. syskill() test case

• 4. syssigwait() test case

• 5. sysopen() with invalid arguments
code:
sysopen(3);

3 is neither keyboard device, therefore error message is printed:
sysopen error

• 6. syswrite() with invalid file descriptor
code: 
syswrite(5, testBuff, strlen(testBuff));

5 is an invalid fd number. Range should be between 0-3. so outputs:
syswrite error

• 7. sysioctl() test for invalid commands
code:
sysioctl(-1, -1, -1);

-1 is an invalid fd and invalid command
output:
ioctl invalid arguments

• 8. sysread() when there are more characters buffered in kernel than the read requests 


• 9. Invalid Login
if User logs in without the correct credentials. The output will be:
Invalid Credentials

• 10. open two keyboards simultaneously:
if one keyboard is already open, error output will be:
ERROR di_open: Keyboard Already Open
